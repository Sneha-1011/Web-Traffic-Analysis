# Web-Traffic-Analysis

Abstract: 
Web Traffic Prediction (WTP) is the process of forecasting future internet traffic. It is a valuable tool for network engineers and operators, as it can help them to plan for and manage network resources more effectively. The WTP includes the Time series analysis, Clustering and Principal component analysis.
The results of this project will be an analytical model that can be used to predict future internet traffic. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical internet traffic data. The model will be evaluated on a holdout dataset of unseen data.
The results of this project will be compared to the results of other methods for web traffic prediction. The results will be used to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Methodology:

In this project, we will use a combination of time series analysis, clustering, and PCA to predict web traffic. The following steps will be used:
1.	Collect web traffic data.
2.	Pre-process the data.
3.	Perform time series analysis on the data.
4.	Perform clustering on the data.
5.	Apply PCA to the data.
6.	Train a machine learning model on the data.
7.	Use the model to predict future web traffic.
